# Hermes Jev — decision sidekick and model router

A native **tool plugin**, not a chat-model provider. Jev supplies bounded semantic judgments and an explicit model recommendation; the main Hermes agent keeps planning, generation, tool execution and responsibility for approvals.

**v0.1.2 is a prerelease. A live Cloudflare Chinese smoke test passed with `jev-1.13.0`; direct TypeSafe access and real-workload accuracy remain unverified.**

## Backends

| Backend | Default model | Credential | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| TypeSafe official | `jev-latest` | `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | `https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone` |
| Cloudflare AI | `typesafe/jev` | `CLOUDFLARE_JEV_API_TOKEN` + non-secret Account ID | `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run` |

Select one explicitly. No cross-provider fallback, credential reuse, automatic retries or redirected authenticated requests. Model aliases may change upstream; results preserve the actual model ID returned.

## Installation

Requires the Hermes Python environment and its native plugin APIs. Developed against Hermes 0.21.3. Older releases are not verified. Python 3.11+ is recommended.

Public repository install (after the release is published):

```sh
hermes plugins install ourines/hermes-jev --enable
hermes jev setup --backend typesafe
# or: hermes jev setup --backend cloudflare
```

For a reproducible install, add `--ref <full-release-commit-sha>` from the release page. This is a community/custom source, not a Hermes catalog entry. Review source before enabling. Installing official skills separately is unnecessary because a pinned official skill is bundled.

For a local checkout, copy this repository's contents to `<HERMES_HOME>/plugins/jev/` (default `~/.hermes/plugins/jev/`). The directory must directly contain `plugin.yaml` and `__init__.py`. Then:

```sh
hermes plugins doctor /path/to/plugins/jev --ci
hermes plugins enable jev --no-allow-tool-override
hermes jev --help
```

A development symlink from that directory to the checkout is also supported on systems with symlink permissions. No edits to the Hermes core checkout are required. Do not copy `.env`, live configuration or credential files into the plugin repository.

## Interactive setup

```sh
hermes jev setup --backend typesafe
# OR
hermes jev setup --backend cloudflare
```

Setup asks for a Cloudflare Account ID when needed, then uses hidden terminal input for the key. It refuses non-interactive/echo-fallback entry. There is deliberately **no `--api-key` argument**. One tiny live evaluation is made before credentials and connection settings are saved. This can incur usage charges. Failed validation does not save the new credential.

Keys use Hermes's credential save path and reside in the active profile's `.env`/credential lifecycle. Non-secret connection settings use `ctx.set_config()` under `plugins.entries.jev.settings.connection`. Setup verifies the writes by read-back without printing credentials. The main model is untouched. A backend switch is explicit and leaves the previous backend's credential available, but inactive. TypeSafe setup updates that profile's `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`; Cloudflare uses a dedicated slot, never a generic Cloudflare token.

```sh
hermes jev status       # local presence only; not evidence of API access
hermes jev test         # one billed Chinese smoke request, three primitives
hermes jev presets      # show shipped rubrics; offline
hermes jev evaluate --file examples/task-triage.json
```

Installation/enabling, live API access, and exposure in a desktop agent tool catalog are separate checks. Confirm `jev_evaluate` and `jev_route` in the actual catalog before claiming native-tool readiness; opening a new chat does not guarantee a long-running backend reloads plugins. Use `hermes jev evaluate --file request.json` or `hermes jev route --file route.json` as the agent-operated fallback, without reinstalling or changing credentials. Do not interrupt active work by restarting the backend without approval.

For first-turn discovery, install the ordinary companion skill from `skills/jev/SKILL.md` into the current profile using `skill_manage` (local name `jev`). Unlike plugin-namespaced skills, ordinary skills appear in the startup skill index. Installation is explicit; plugin loading never writes user skills. The companion handles “测试 Jev”, usage questions, task judgments and status-only requests, with native-tool/CLI fallback and billing boundaries. It does not run inference automatically. `hermes jev guide` is an offline onboarding command. `status` reports local configuration only; its legacy `online_verified: false` means no live check was performed, not that authentication failed.

## Cloudflare third-party model prerequisites

`typesafe/jev` is a third-party model routed through **AI Gateway**, not an `@cf/` hosted model. An active Workers AI token and readable model catalog do not prove Unified Billing can execute it.

1. Use an authenticated AI Gateway and sufficient Unified Billing credits (or separately supported provider credentials). Prefer a dedicated gateway; enabling authentication on a shared default gateway may affect existing applications.
2. The `/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run` route uses a Cloudflare API token with **Workers AI Read** in the standard `Authorization` header. Do not replace it with a token holding only AI Gateway permissions. Gateway-management permissions are separate. See current Cloudflare docs if the authentication-token template asks for additional Run permissions.
3. Configure the gateway explicitly:

```sh
hermes jev setup --backend cloudflare --account-id YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --gateway-id YOUR_GATEWAY_ID
```

This stores `gateway_id` as a nonsecret connection setting. Omitting it retains Cloudflare's default route; the plugin never creates a gateway, changes its authentication settings, purchases credits or enables auto-top-up.

Cloudflare requests disable gateway log collection and cache use and cap gateway attempts to one via explicit headers. Also review your gateway's own settings and any upstream retention policy; these headers are not a claim of end-to-end zero data retention.

A **403 / provider code 2049** means Unified Billing needs authenticated gateway access. Check the target gateway's authentication first; do not repeatedly regenerate a token or assume the model is unavailable. A user-token verification success can coexist with account-token verification failure because they are different token classes.

## Agent interface

Two tools are available:

- **`jev_evaluate`** for bounded classification, choice, yes/no and scoring. Exactly one of `preset` and `questions` is required.
- **`jev_route`** for selecting one model profile for a task. It asks one finite choice question and returns top-level `selected_model`, `confidence`, and review status (the full decision is also under `route`). With `apply: true` (the default), an accepted result arms a request-scoped model override for subsequent Hermes provider requests in the current turn. It never switches providers or grants execution approval.

Configure reusable non-secret profiles under the plugin setting `model_routes`:

```json
[
  {"id":"fast","model":"your-cheap-model","description":"Simple Q&A, formatting and small edits; low cost and fast."},
  {"id":"reasoning","model":"your-reasoning-model","description":"Complex debugging, multi-file changes and long-chain reasoning.","cost_tier":"high"}
]
```

Or pass `candidates` directly to `jev_route`. Example request:

```json
{"task":"修复登录故障并补测试","min_confidence":0.8}
```

Set the profiles through Hermes's supported config command (replace the model IDs with values configured in the active profile):

```sh
hermes config set plugins.entries.jev.settings.model_routes '[{"id":"fast","model":"your-cheap-model","description":"Simple Q&A, formatting and small edits; low cost and fast."},{"id":"reasoning","model":"your-reasoning-model","description":"Complex debugging, multi-file changes and long-chain reasoning.","cost_tier":"high"}]'
hermes config set plugins.entries.jev.settings.route_min_confidence 0.8
```

`route_min_confidence` is an optional threshold. When confidence is missing or below it, `route_needs_review` is true and no model override is armed. Thresholds are not calibrated accuracy guarantees. Routing changes only the outgoing request's `model` field for the current turn; it does not rewrite the persistent Hermes default or change providers.

```json
{"state":"线上登录白屏，请先排查原因。", "preset":"task_triage"}
```

```json
{
  "state": {"goal":"Repair login", "recent_attempts":["Three identical retries"], "observations":["Same 401"], "permissions":"Read-only diagnosis"},
  "preset":"next_step"
}
```

```json
{"state":{"goal":"Find deployment documentation", "item":"Recipe for soup"}, "preset":"relevance"}
```

For domain-specific decisions, pass named `questions` using Noul/Choice/Score. Consult `examples/custom.json`. Ask independent questions about the same state in one request. The first release supports text instructions and textual criteria (a deliberately smaller subset than the full upstream structured instruction schema).

Load the runtime guide with `skill_view(name="jev:decision-sidekick")`; load the unmodified official design skill with `skill_view(name="jev:typesafe-ai")`. Provenance and MIT notice: `UPSTREAM.json` and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. It teaches when NOT to call Jev as well as the fast path. This is on-demand assistance: no message surveillance, loop hooks, automatic Kanban mutation or implicit model routing.

### Returned information

- `ok`, upstream `model`, `answers`, `usage`, plus backend and measured request latency.
- Raw probability distributions/confidence when supplied by the provider; never invented probabilities.
- `review`: per-question review signals, `advisory_only: true`, `execution_authorized: false`.
- Safe errors rather than request bodies, headers or raw provider errors.

Threshold review is **disabled by default**. Raw judgments remain available for the caller to compose; low confidence is not automatically a failed decision. If explicitly configured, the review threshold is an **uncalibrated heuristic**, not a correctness guarantee. Noul uses the yes-probability bands, not a fabricated confidence. Choice/Score use provider confidence; missing confidence triggers review. Unknown/ask-user/escalate choices trigger review. Risk or missing-context signals may trigger review even when confident. Low uncertainty never substitutes for permission.

To explicitly enable this heuristic using the supported configuration interface (choose a threshold using held-out workload data, not this example):

```sh
hermes config set plugins.entries.jev.settings.review_threshold 0.9
hermes config set plugins.entries.jev.settings.route_min_confidence 0.8
```

## Safety and privacy

- State is sent to the selected external provider. Minimize it and remove credentials/private data before calling.
- No background calls, cross-provider failover, automatic retries, auto-approval or action execution.
- Fixed provider hosts; authenticated redirects are refused. HTTP proxy environment variables are ignored (`trust_env=False`); use an OS-level network route if needed. Requests have per-I/O timeouts (not an overall deadline) and local size limits.
- Credentials/settings are resolved per invocation and profile; no module-global credential cache.
- Prompt wording is not a security boundary. Jev is NOT the sole guardrail for tool safety or permissions.
- API errors return fail-closed advice; the main agent decides whether to ask the user or use other tools. A network error never becomes a synthetic decision.
- No persistent prompt/answer logging or telemetry in the plugin. Hermes's ordinary tool transcript may still retain tool arguments/results.

## Testing

Run from this directory using the Python interpreter in the Hermes environment:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
hermes plugins doctor . --ci
hermes plugins validate .
hermes plugins compat .
```

Tests use clearly labelled local fixtures, not real model outputs. Profile tests exercise actual Hermes config and secret-scope APIs through temporary A → B → A homes. They never write to a user's real profile. Plugin Doctor exercises actual loading/registration while blocking network during registration.

`hermes jev test` is a live connectivity + trivial semantic smoke test, **not an accuracy benchmark**. Before downstream automation, label real Chinese workload data, split prompt-tuning and held-out samples, and compare rules/Jev/main-model on class errors, risk misses, review coverage, p50/p95 latency and total cost including fallbacks. Keep high-risk work under human approval.

## Roadmap boundaries

Useful follow-ups are an offline dataset runner and opt-in application adapters for Kanban/Obsidian. They are not installed or activated by this release. Do not infer production reliability from the synthetic smoke test.
